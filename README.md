# An educational game to test your Japanese vocabulary

⚠️This was an early project of mine and it could use refactors (for example, non-optimal Redux usage)⚠️

Generate a two-kanji word and guess if it's a real Japanese word

Earn points - the quicker you answer, the more you get

Providing a wrong answer makes you lose a life
